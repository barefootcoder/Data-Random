Revision history for Data::Random.

        - added rand_image()

        - used Carp::cluck() and returned undef on errors instead of
            calling die, thus making it a little more friendly

        - correctly made "shuffle" flag default to 1 for rand_words(),
            rand_chars() and rand_set()  (Thanks to David Sarno)
            
        - fixed bug where rand_words() would sometimes return less words
            than what's specified in "min"  (Thanks to David Sarno)

        - allowed results of rand_set() to be unshuffled

        - added a plethora of tests (how's one supposed to
            accurately the test validity of random data anyway?)
